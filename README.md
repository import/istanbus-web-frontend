### Istanbus Web Frontend

We made this project just for fun and learning new frontend technologies.

The first version written with JQuery at 2012. Then rewritten with Angular JS 1 at 2013 includes SSR support. For the mapping we used Openstreetmap tiles provided by Cloudmade.

Contents of the repository regularly syncronized to [http://istanbus.org](http://istanbus.org).

API of this service written is Erlang, hosted in [here](https://github.com/mpaltun/istanbus).
